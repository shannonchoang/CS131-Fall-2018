Using speedup, I calculated the ratio of plaintower's cputime to tower's cputime. 
Results:
98.8
97.62
98.05


This is the function call for the first ambiguous towers I found. 
ambiguous(4,C,T1,T2).
C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
